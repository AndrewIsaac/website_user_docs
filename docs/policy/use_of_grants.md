# Use of Grants

The VLSCI will issue a statement of offer to successful applicants to the Resource Allocation Scheme (RAS). The offer will indicate the level of resources granted and the terms and conditions under which these resources can be used.

CIs should be aware that the grants awarded are entitlements to use the computing resources uniformly over a specified period of time. In order to make effective use of the Peak Computing Facility (PCF), procedures will be developed to allow some flexibility to use these resources at different rates over this period of time.

Users need to be aware that information about the level of activity of their account on the system may be observable by other users and that the staff of the PCF may monitor the contents of job scripts.
