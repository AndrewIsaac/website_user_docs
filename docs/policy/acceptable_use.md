# Acceptable Use of VLSCI facilities

Chief Investigators (CIs) must endeavour to request physical resources that reasonably reflect the needs of their team.

CIs must acknowledge that they and project team members will abide by the acceptable use policy for the PCF. CIs and users nominated by them must agree to abide by the Information Infrastructure and Services Rules, as documented in [Regulation 8.3.R2 of The University of Melbourne's Statutes & Regulations](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/Statutes/contents.html#S8).

In addition to the University of Melbourne policy, the following must be observed:

* All account holders must use suitable secure credentials to access the PCF and must never share those credentials in any way. Specifically:
    * Never disclose your password or share it with anyone, including fellow project members or VLSCI staff.
    * If you use SSH key authentication, always protect your SSH private key with a suitably long passphrase (a sentence may be easier to remember). Never disclose or share it.
* Account holders whose circumstances change in a way that may affect their entitlement to use the PCF or whose contact details change must inform VLSCI (please advise via the Help Tracking System).
* Project Leaders must provide appropriate reports on activities related to VLSCI when requested.
* Users of the PCF must abide by the software licenses for all the applications they use, no matter how obtained.
* Users of the PCF must hold VLSCI blameless in the event that data is lost or access by an authorised person or the facility is unavailable or operating incorrectly.

[University of Melbourne's Privacy Policy](http://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1104)

Users must not share login accounts or let others know their passwords for PCF system access.

CIs must accept the responsibility for the acceptable use of the PCF by team members.
