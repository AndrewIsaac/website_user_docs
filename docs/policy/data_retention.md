# Data retention

While VLSCI will make every effort to keep your data safe and secure, it cannot guarantee to do so. The following policies apply to data retention:

* CIs must implement a backup plan that keeps important data safe.
* Files that are accidentally deleted may be recovered from tape but depending on circumstances, this is not always possible.
* If a project does not continue to receive grants of quota or that quota is unused for some time, files belonging to project members (especially large files or lots of small files) need to be removed from the system.
* VLSCI provides its active users with a substantial but not unlimited quantity of high speed storage space. From time to time VLSCI may contact you requesting you remove unnecessary files or suggesting alternative storage arrangements.
