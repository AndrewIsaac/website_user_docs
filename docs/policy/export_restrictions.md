# US Export Conditions

Some VLSCI facilities are subject to US Export Control guidelines that prohibit use of these facilities by nationals of certain countries. When we create user accounts we may seek information about the user's nationality to determine whether or not they are permitted to use some of the facilities, particularly the Blue Gene computer, in accordance with US export restrictions. VLSCI will only use the information for a lawful purpose.
