# Types of Projects

Find out what types of projects are eligible to receive resource grants and see the range of Life Sciences research already supported by VLSCI.

## Life Sciences

The VLSCI provides computational access and expertise to research projects in the field of Life Sciences.  Link here to section defining Life Sciences.

## Nature of Research Projects

Applications to the Resource Allocation Scheme must be for academic projects and not commercial contracts. This means that the project cannot be work done on behalf of a commercial organisation.

Projects that have commercial sponsors, where the computational results are interpreted and value-added for these sponsors, are acceptable.

Projects that are for commercial contracts will be considered separately and inquiries should be made in writing to the PCF Manager.

## Scope of Research Projects

Chief Investigators (CIs) may apply for resources for a specific project involving collaborators from different organisations.

Projects with members outside of Victoria must demonstrate that the main benefits of the project lie within Victoria.

The intention of 'super-projects' is to provide flexibility to a major or high-priority research area. In the future, grants may be made for more than one year to provide a longer-term commitment to the research area.

Super-projects could be granted larger quantities of resources and might be logically divided into 'sub-projects'. Super-projects will manage internally the total resources granted and gain a level of flexibility by doing so.

## Projects that have already received Resource Grants

In three rounds of Resource Applications, VLSCI has already granted resources to a wide range of projects.  To see examples of the types of projects that VLSCI supports, please see our [current research projects](https://www.vlsci.org.au/page/current-research).
