# Tips for writing a successful RAS Application

This section explains what type of information the RAS committee is seeking when they review new applications. It provides explanations of terminology and tips to ensure your responses maximise the likelihood of receiving a resource allocation.  Many of the tips will be found in each of the Summary and Part A to F links below.  Please use these as a guide only!

## General Information

Once you commence an application you will receive a unique URL (web address) by email as part of the registration process. The only way you can access your application is via this link, so please keep the email and its unique link safe. While you may share the link with other participants in a project, we recommend that only one person edits the application form at any time. Concurrent edits are possible, but they risk overwriting the other person's input.  

The interface used for this application tracks input into each of the sections and can not be saved with out  filling in the necessary fields.  However it does this without evaluation of the content, and will list these as ‘OK' even if more content is required. It is your responsibility to ensure that each of the sections is completed adequately by the closing date, as the RAS Committee will consider applications with all sections marked with ‘OK’ on the Summary Page.

Further information about the summary of the application is available on the Summary page.

The size of your application is determined in Part E.  The application will be classified as moderate, average or substantial based on the values you enter in Part E.  For applications classed as average or substantial, there will be additional questions in Part A and Part D.  If you change the amounts in Part E, please check the additional questions.

You can grab a PDF snapshot of the draft proposal at any time and circulate it amongst the project participants for review.  You are also welcome to email it to the VLSCI PCF Manager who can comment on matters such as "is this adequate/appropriate?". Email the PCF Manager at least three working days before the closing date for RAS applications.

A brief synopsis of the application form pages is also available.

## Required Information and navigation

The project application asks for a range of information and applicants are strongly advised to fill in all the fields. Watch for a scroll bar in you browser if you are not working with a wide window, some fields can appear well to the right hand side.

Each page contains navigation buttons at the top and bottom of the page  that will take you to the next or previous section. There is also a summary button which will take you directly to the summary page and a save page button to save the current state. The save button is  useful when filling in a page to ensure that data isn't lost, and in particular when filling in the amount of resources you are requesting.  For Parts B and Part  E, this will also allow you to add new fields.  Note that any action which leaves the current page will save that page.

You can use standard editing commands to copy (ctrl-C) and paste (ctrl-V)  from a variety of sources, including pdf files and screen shots, to help you fill in the form.  Drag-drop will also work in most cases.  The standard ctrl-Z command will also undo a previous edit or paste.  (However, ctrl-Z will not work once the page is saved.)

Please note that ALL HIGHLIGHTED (pale yellow) areas must contain valid text.  In Part E, note that the drop down pre-filled entries must be selected to some value.  If you are unsure, choose **I don't know**.
