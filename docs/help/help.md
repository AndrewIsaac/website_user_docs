## Tips for using the Help Tracking System

As this one Help Tracking System covers a very wide range of services provided by VLSCI, not all of these things will apply to your specific request. This list is particularly focused on technical problems relating to using the super computers, but don't let that stop you from using the system for other, non technical matters.

* Can you identify the particular machine you are experiencing the problem with? Possibly Barcoo, Merri or Avoca.
* A copy and paste of any error message you see on screen is often helpful.
* An outline of what you were doing, or trying to do when the problem happened may put the issue in context.
